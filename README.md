# Heart Failure Prediction 

## Introduction: 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Problem Statement: 
To predict the chances of heart failure and studying the factors associated with it (such as Cholesterol levels, type of ChestPain, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure)

## Dataset: 
heart.csv imported from our github repository
