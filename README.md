# Heart Failure Prediction 

## Introduction: 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Problem Statement: 
To predict the chances of heart failure and studying the factors associated with it (such as Cholesterol levels, type of ChestPain, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure)

## Dataset: 
heart.csv imported from our github repository

## Observations:
<li>We observe that the Dataset has 12 Columns, (Age, Sex, ChestPainType, Resting BloodPressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG. Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise Angina, Old Peak, ST_Slope and Heart Disease(present or absent)</ul>
<li>Resting BP and Cholesterol has zero as minimum which is not possible unless the patient is dead. </ul>
<li>There may be outliers/Missings in Cholesterol and Resting BP being presented as zero. </ul>
<li>The interquartile range of MaxHR suggests that there maybe outliers from Min to 1st quartile. </ul>
